\begin{abstract}
Water treatment is one of those essential elements of modern life
that is taken for granted by the general population.
We describe the ability to remotely understand and
improve water chemistry using IoT devices attached to the cloud.
The commercial benefits of this IoT connectivity are substantial,
including: reduced chemical usage, improved chemical inventory 
management, safer operation (fewer and less critical alarms),
reduced maintenance costs, and higher quality water.
