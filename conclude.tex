\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclude}

EZAnalytics provides an operational ability to collect water chemistry
data from a collection of control equipment.  This data collection
is secure, and supports multiple levels of data analysis.
The initial deployment provides summary data to equipment owners/operators
about the water chemistry under their direct control.
This has direct implications for inventory management as well as
reduction in maintenance expenses.

The promise, however, is potentially substantially more beneficial.  We will
be able to use data from multiple installations to learn broad truths
about water chemistry control that can be shared across the industry.
This will result in lower chemical usage, fewer alarm
conditions or anomalous events,
and overall better control over water chemistry.
